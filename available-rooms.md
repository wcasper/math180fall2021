The university recognizes that some students may have a mix of in-person and online courses this semester.  Ideally, you shouldn't have to search frantically for an open space to take your online class while on campus.  With this in mind, the following classrooms have been reserved during the indicated times for use by students attending class online.
Note that listed by each room is the room capacity and seating is first-come first-served.
