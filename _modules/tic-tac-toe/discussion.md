## Part 1: Rules
* Discuss within your group what the rules are for playing tic-tac-toe.  Make sure to carefully describe how to play the game, what each player can or must do on their turn, under what conditions the game ends, and what determines the winner (or a tie).

* Create and share a google document where you explicitly type up the set of rules that your group agreed on.
Make sure every group member has access to this later!

## Part 2: Loopholes

* Carefully examine the rules that you created in Part 1.
Try to find a loophole: a way to do something that you know you shouldn't be able to do in tic-tac-toe, but which technically obeys the rules that you came up with.
Whenever you find something, discuss it with your group members and explain what modifications of the rules you made in Part 1 are required to close the loophole.

If your rules were ironclad in Part 1 and you cannot find any loopholes, then instead come up with a way that you can change the rules so that they still appear solid, but so there is a clever trick that you can now exploit to your advantage.

* Summarize your group's discussion in the google document.
* Save your google doc as a PDF and upload it to Canvas.
